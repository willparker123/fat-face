The semantic significance of this change in occupation could render this counterfactual meaningless to an end user. Futhermore, if we examine the list of alternative counterfactual instances in the dataset we can find two instances where occupation is \"Exec Managerial\" with associated age and education levels of 30, 13 and 26, 14 and 23, 13 respectively. \n",

    "The above table shows the original instance, the generated counterfactual under the Euclidean distance measure and the generated counterfactual under UDM. We can see that both counterfactuals change the occupation of the original instance, maintain the education level and have equal changes to the age variable. If we explore the data further, the table below shows how the Machine Operator Inspector occupation have more instances which are similar across the age and education features to the original instance than the Sales occupation. This shows how the Unified Distance Measure generates counterfactuals which are more true to the distribution of the underlying data than the Euclidean distance measure.  "
